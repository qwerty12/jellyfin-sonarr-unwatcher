Unmonitor episodes in Sonarr when watching in Jellyfin

Basic Go clone of unmonitorr except that this only supports Jellyfin and Sonarr. (I don't use Radarr.) This contains the benefits (IMO) of [my unmonitorr fork](https://github.com/qwerty12/unmonitorr).

I don't like JavaScript, don't like that Node uses 60 MB of private memory for just this and find the Node ecosystem awkward (to deal with on Windows). (Though, while still much better by comparison, Go's 14 MB isn't anything to write home about, either...)

Unmonitorr's original README goes into how to set this up with Jellyfin, including configuring shemanaev's Webhook plugin.
The procedure is the same here; however, the `SONARR_HOST` environment variable must be explicitly set by you.

This also rips off prefetcharr - to enable, set the `REMAINING_EPISODES` environment variable to something like `2`, and configure the following webhook:

| Option         | Value                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| URL            | `http://127.0.0.1:9898/prefetcharr` |
| Payload format | Default                             |
| Events         | Scrobble                            |
